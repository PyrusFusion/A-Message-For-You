<h1 style="color:pink;font-size:5vw">To My Princess....</h1>
<p style="color:white;">I see you almost every day...<br>
Yet I find myself missing you...<br>
Every second of the way...
<br>

The softness of your lips and the gentle sparkle in your eyes mean so much to me...
<br>

<p3>I want to be able to keep that smile on you... through hard times and easy times, I want to cherish every moment I have with you.</p3> 
<br>

<p4>The kisses you give can be compared to the paradise in heaven... Melting with a simple touch of your lips...</p4>
<br>

<p5>I miss the feeling of warmth that I get when I hold you in my arms... </p5>
<br>

You are so imperfect yet I find you to be the only perfect person in my eyes, so much so that I run out of words and phrases to express how perfect you are to me....
<br>

I love you Brianna. I don't know how to stop and I am sorry for causing you so much pain in the past.
<br>

Thank you for being with me through all those hard times. I don't deserve someone as amazing as you. So many persons are searching for someone special, and I was too blind to see that mine was with me the entire time.

<h1 style="color:pink;font-size:5vw">Why I Love You</h1>
<p style="color:white;">As a question you constantly ask, I will give you an answer which you can always go back to.
<br>
<p style="color:white;">
You have seen me at my worst, yet you chose to love me despite your pain. I know your endurance has a limit, but you chose to endure for as long as you could.
<br>
<p style="color:white;">Being with you always cheered me up. Just looking at your face is enough to keep me smiling for hours. I wish others could see the perfection that I see through my eyes. 
<br>
<p style="color:white;">You were always there for me. You cared for me like a mother cares for her child, and I know that it was the purest form of love anyone can ever wish for. 
<br>
<p style="color:white;">I love you for being you.

<p style="color:white;">
I wish to be the one that you share your future with. I don't wish to ever hurt you. I am sorry for all the pain I have caused you since the time we met and I ask you to forgive me for any mistake I make in the future cause I will never intentionally hurt you, for you are the one and only woman for me and the only person that I wish to spend the rest of my life with.
